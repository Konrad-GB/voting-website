## Step 6: Test Your Deployment

1. Once deployed, visit your URL (e.g., `your-app.vercel.app`)
2. Click **Host Session**
3. Login:
   - Username: `GrowthBossHosting`
   - Password: `y&%)U#2+${QF/wG7`

## How the Hybrid System Works

**When you upload media:**

```
Image file (JPG, PNG, GIF)
  ↓
  → ImgBB (unlimited bandwidth)
  ↓
  Stored forever, unlimited views ✅

Video file (MP4, MOV, etc.)
  ↓
  → Cloudinary with auto-compression
  ↓
  Compressed to 720p (~70% size reduction)
  ↓
  Stored within free tier limits ✅
```

**Result:** Best of both worlds!

## Automatic Compression

Videos are automatically compressed to:

## Troubleshooting

### "Session not found" error
- Check Upstash environment variables in Vercel
- Redeploy after adding env variables

### Image upload fails
- Verify `IMGBB_API_KEY` is correct (no spaces)
- Check https://api.imgbb.com/ to verify API key is active

### Video upload fails
- Check all 3 Cloudinary variables are correct
- Verify API Secret has no spaces
- Make sure video is under 100 MB before upload

### Can't access environment variables
- Go to Vercel: **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
- All 6 variables must be added for **Production**
- Redeploy the project after adding

## Updating Your App

```bash
# Make changes locally
